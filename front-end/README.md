## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **/back-end:** The Node.js & Express.js backend. It handles API logic, web scraping, database interactions, and user authentication.
- **/front-end:** The React frontend. It provides the user interface and consumes the data from the server's API.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed and running on your machine, or a MongoDB Atlas connection string.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/teri1712/novel.git
    cd novel
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd back-end

    # Install dependencies
    npm install


3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the front-end directory from the root
    cd ../front-end

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```sh
    # From the /server directory
    npm start
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080` (or the port you specified).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```sh
    # From the /front-end directory (in a new terminal)
    npm start
    ```
    The React application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
